- **Java EE** = collection of abstract specifications that together form a complete solution for solving commonly faced challenges in software development.

- **Application Server** = concrete implementation of Java EE abstract specifications.
Application Server Examples: Payara Server (Glassfish), IBM OpenLiberty, JBoss Wildfly

- **JSR (Java Specification Request)** = formal request to the Java community process for addition and enhancements to technologies. It is a body that standardizes APIs on the Java technology platform and is used to group APIS into silos, e.g. JAX-RS (Java API for RESTful Web Services).
= For every JSR, there is a **reference implementation**.

- **Reference Implementation** = Concrete realization of an abstract JSR. For instance, the reference implementation for JAX-RS is called Jersey. 
= Java EE itself is a JSR. Thus, an application server is a collection of the various reference implementations for the Java EE JSR. For example, Java EE is JSR 366 and one of its reference implementations is Glassfish 5.

- **Jakarta EE** = Java EE going forward. Oracle moved the Java platform to be hosted by the Eclipse Foundation (https://jakarta.ee). Thus the new cloud native Java EE is hosted at Eclipse Foundation.

- **Java EE and Spring Framework** = both influenced each other
